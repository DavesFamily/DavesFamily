### Create a production-ready build

```
npx frontity build
```

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.

This will create a `/build` folder with a `server.js` (a [serverless function](https://vercel.com/docs/v2/serverless-functions/introduction)) file and a `/static` folder with all your javascript files and other assets.

Your app is ready to be deployed.

### Deploy

With the files generated in the _build_ you can deploy your project.

#### As a node app

Use `npx frontity serve` to run it like a normal Node app.

This command generates (and runs) a small web server that uses the generated `server.js` and `/static` to serve your content.
